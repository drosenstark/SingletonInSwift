# SingletonInSwift
This is an attempt to make an Interface-Builder-friendly Singleton in Swift as mentioned [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37711521/use-singleton-in-interface-builder-with-swift).

It all works, but **somehow** the vc1 variable in the test becomes nil after it's set (and the setter is not called again). Baffling!

Any help or advice would be appreciated.
